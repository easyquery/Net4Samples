# EasyQuery Samples for .NET 4.x (closed).

> This repository is closed now. Use [this one](https://github.com/easyquery/DotNetSamples) instead.

## Why?

It used to store .NET 4.x sample projects for [EasyQuery library](https://korzh.com/easyquery) however after EasyQuery 7.0 release all samples were moved to [easyquery/DotNetSamples repository](https://github.com/easyquery/DotNetSamples). So, please open that repository to get the latest samples!
